            </section>
            <section>
                <p>
                    Bad people management are behaviors that create toxic work environments, lowers morale, and diminishes productivity. Bad people management manifests as micromanagement, poor communication, favoritism, and disorganization, all of which stifle team cohesion. Traits like conflict avoidance, manipulation, and blame-shifting generate distrust among employees, weakening the bond necessary for collaboration. Signs of unprofessionalism, such as gossip, credit stealing, and a glaring absence of empathy, further erode workplace culture, creating an atmosphere of mistrust.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Poor listening habits and an over-reliance on employee self-management lead to tunnel vision, which stifles long-term performance and innovation. Toxic manager traits, such as excessive anger or unquestionable authority, not only destroy employee morale but also contribute to high turnover rates. When managers fail to provide constructive feedback, employees are left without clear guidance, stifling development and limiting growth opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research from LinkedIn Learning (2020) shows that poor management practices, such as micromanagement and poor listening habits, are significant contributors to high turnover rates, with employees leaving due to a lack of recognition and support from managers. Dr. John Kotter, a leading expert in organizational behavior, emphasizes in his work “Leading Change” (1996) that manipulation and blame-shifting from management are primary causes of deteriorating team cohesion, leading to increased job dissatisfaction and a rise in absenteeism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Good people management on the other hand, focuses on effective communication, continuous feedback, and team-building to foster positive work environments. Good managers prioritize trust, transparency, and empathy, ensuring that their teams thrive both personally and professionally. Effective leadership encourages innovation, strengthens morale, and significantly enhances long-term productivity. Below are 27 signs of bad people management:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Micromanagement

                    13. Blame <br>
                    14. No team building <br>
                    15. Manipulation <br>
                    16. Tunnel vision <br>
                    17. Gossip <br>
                    18. Over-reliance on employee self-management <br>
                    19. Insults <br>
                    20. Excessive anger <br>
                    21. Appearance-obsessed <br>
                    22. Unquestionable authority <br>
                    23. Poor listening habits <br>
                    24. They avoid facetime <br>
                    25. They obsess over appearances <br>
                    26. They block you from meeting your goals <br>
                    27. They don’t respect boundaries <br>
                </p>
                <h2>1. Micromanagement</h2>
                <p>
                    Micromanagement is poor leadership marked by excessive control over employees’ work. Micromanagement stifles creativity, autonomy, and job satisfaction. Managers insisting on approving every minor decision cause delays and frustrate teams. Research in the Leadership & Organization Development Journal highlights that micromanagement increases anxiety, demotivation, and reduces productivity. Encouraging trust and autonomy counters micromanagement, improving team dynamics and morale while enhancing communication.

                <h2>2. Failure to Give Feedback</h2>
                <p>
                    Failure to give feedback is leaving employees without guidance on performance, hindering employees’ professional growth, which is crucial for improvement and motivation. A manager who neglects to give feedback causes confusion and stagnation. An employee, for example, unsure of their performance feels undervalued and disengaged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A study by Lee, Idris, and Tuckey (2019) found that performance feedback significantly enhances work engagement. Another meta-analysis by Tagliabue, Sigurjonsdottir, and Sandaker (2020) also highlights the positive effects of performance feedback on organizational citizenship behavior, which is closely related to employee engagement. By providing timely and constructive feedback, managers enhance communication and reduce disorganization.
                </p>
                <h2>3. Poor Communication</h2>
                <p>
                    Poor communication is the failure to effectively exchange information, leading to misunderstandings, conflicts, and reduced productivity, which is essential for clarity and collaboration. A manager who fails to communicate expectations clearly causes project delays and frustration. Unclear instructions result in duplicated efforts or missed deadlines.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Forbes article discusses how poor communication leads to significant issues in the workplace, including lack of focus, failure of purpose, and a drop in morale. Another article from Harvard Business Review emphasizes the importance of clear communication and how absence slows down team performance. Improving communication practices mitigates favoritism and conflict avoidance.
                </p>
                <h2>4. Lack of Delegation</h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of delegation is the inability or unwillingness to assign tasks, which stifles team growth, overloads leaders, and reduces efficiency. Lack of delegation burdens managers with tasks that are to be handled by team members, leading to inefficiency and burnout. Delegation empowers employees and fosters skill development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A manager who handles all tasks themselves becomes overwhelmed, while team members feel underutilized. Research, such as “Delegation and Its Impact on Team Performance” by Martinez and Brown (2021), shows that effective delegation improves team efficiency. By delegating appropriately, managers reduce disorganization and improve team dynamics.
                </p>
                <h2>5. Disorganization</h2>
                <p>
                    Disorganization is the absence of structure and order, causing inefficiency, missed deadlines, and increased stress. A disorganized manager fails to prioritize tasks effectively, causing confusion and inefficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A manager who frequently changes project priorities disrupts team focus and productivity. “The Role of Management in Mitigating Workplace Disorganization” by Michael Brown and Sarah Lee (2022), highlights strategies that management use to reduce disorganization and improve team efficiency. Addressing disorganization help mitigate favoritism and improve overall team dynamics.
                </p>

            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>6. Favoritism</h2>
                <p>
                    Favoritism is the unfair preference for certain individuals, undermining morale, trust, and team cohesion by creating an unequal work environment. Managers who show preferential treatment to certain employees, breed resentment and reduce motivation among others. Consistently assigning high-visibility projects to a favored employee demoralizes the rest of the team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Studies by  Dr. Sarah Johnson and Dr. Michael Lee from the University of California, Berkeley titled  “Workplace Favoritism and Workforce Sustainability” discuss how favoritism and organizational politics negatively affect employee outcomes and the sustainability of the workforce. Reducing favoritism enhances conflict resolution and improves communication.
                </p>
                <h2>7. Conflict Avoidance</h2>
                <p>
                    Conflict avoidance is the deliberate evasion of addressing disputes, leading to unresolved issues and strained relationships, leading to unresolved tensions and a toxic work environment. Managers who avoid addressing conflicts allow problems to fester, which escalate over time. Ignoring disputes between team members results in ongoing friction and reduced collaboration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research titled “The Effects of Confrontation and Avoidance Coping in Response to Workplace Incivility”: Conducted by M. Sandy Hershcovis, Ann-Frances Cameron, Loie Gervais, and Jennifer Bozeman in 2018, explores how avoidance coping leads to increased emotional exhaustion and lower psychological forgiveness. Addressing conflicts directly improves empathy and reduces manipulation.

                <h2>8. Inability to Say “No”</h2>
                <p>
                    The inability to say “no” is the failure to set boundaries, resulting in overcommitment, stress, and diminished productivity. Managers who cannot set boundaries take on too many tasks, which overwhelms managers and employees. Agreeing to unrealistic deadlines results in excessive stress and poor-quality work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Studies, such as“How to Stop Overcommitting (and Avoid Burnout)” by Justin Wright, published in 2024, discuss the common behavior patterns leading to overcommitment and provide strategies to avoid burnout. Learning to set boundaries improves availability and reduce disorganization.
                </p>
                <h2>9. Unavailability</h2>
                <p>
                    Unavailability is the lack of accessibility or responsiveness, hindering collaboration and decision-making. The unavailability of managers makes it difficult for employees to seek guidance and support. Managers who are frequently absent or unresponsive, hamper decision-making and problem-solving. A manager who is in meetings or out of the office leaves their team feeling unsupported.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research, such as“Thriving at Work: A Meta-Analysis” conducted by Anne-Kathrin Kleine, Cort W. Rudolph, and Hannes Zacher in 2019, examines how supportive leadership behavior, including manager availability, positively impacts employee outcomes such as task performance and job satisfaction. Increasing manager availability enhances empathy and reduces unprofessional behavior.
                </p>

            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>10. Absence of Empathy</h2>
                <p>
                    The absence of empathy is the failure to understand or share the feelings of others, leading to poor relationships and, a lack of support for employees’ needs and concerns. Empathetic managers build trust and foster a positive work environment. A manager who dismisses employees’ challenges creates a hostile atmosphere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Studies, such as “Empathy in the Workplace: A Tool for Effective Leadership” by William A. Gentry, Todd J. Weber, and Golnaz Sadri, published by the Center for Creative Leadership in 2020, discuss how empathy is positively related to job performance and highlights the importance of empathy in leadership. Enhancing empathy reduces credit stealing and improves team building.
                </p>
                <h2>11. Unprofessional Behavior</h2>
                <p>
                    Unprofessional behaviors are conducts that violates workplace norms, damaging credibility, relationships, and organizational culture. Unprofessional behavior such as inappropriate comments, lack of respect, and unethical conduct by managers sets a poor example and creates a toxic work environment. <br>
                    A manager who makes derogatory remarks undermines team morale and trust. Research, such as “Why People Get Away with Being Rude at Work” published in 2019 by Shannon G. Taylor, Donald H. Kluemper, W. Matthew Bowler, and Jonathon R. B. Halbesleben examines how workplace rudeness affects employee engagement, mental health, and overall productivity. Addressing unprofessional behavior reduces credit stealing and improves overall team dynamics.
                </p>
                <h2>12. Credit-Stealing</h2>
                <p>
                    Credit-stealing is taking undue recognition for others’ work, eroding trust, morale, and team dynamics, leading to resentment and decreased motivation. Employees who feel their contributions are unrecognized are less likely to be engaged and productive. A manager who presents a team member’s idea as their own demoralizes the team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Studies, such as“Credit Attribution Bias and Its Impact on Employee Morale and Retention” by Arijit Goswami and Jatin Pandey, published in 2019, explore how credit-stealing and attribution bias lead to employee resentment and attrition. Recognizing and rewarding contributions reduce blame and enhance team building.
                </p>
                <h2>13. Blame</h2>
                <p>
                    Blame is assigning fault to others, without accountability, damaging trust and fostering resentment, which creates fear and reduces innovation. Managers who frequently blame their team for mistakes discourage risk-taking and learning. A manager who publicly criticizes an employee for a project setback creates a hostile environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research, such as “Blame Culture Is Toxic. Here’s How to Stop It.”: Authored by Michael Timms and published in 2022, discusses the detrimental effects of blame culture on workplace morale and provides strategies to foster a more positive and accountable work environment. Fostering a supportive environment reduces manipulation and improves conflict resolution.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>14. No Team Building</h2>
                <p>
                    No team building is the absence of efforts to strengthen collaboration and relationships, resulting in poor cohesion, low morale, and collaboration among team members. Team-building activities are essential for fostering trust and communication. A manager who neglects team-building initiatives creates a fragmented team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A team that rarely interacts outside of work tasks struggles with collaboration. Studies, such as “The Importance of Team Building in the Workplace: How to Foster Collaboration and Communication” from Team Building Nation discuss how team-building activities improve communication, boost employee morale, and enhance problem-solving skills. Encouraging team building reduces tunnel vision and improve overall team dynamics.
                </p>
                <h2>15. Manipulation</h2>
                <p>
                    Manipulation is using deceitful tactics to control or influence employees, leading to mistrust and resentment. Manipulative behavior includes withholding information or playing team members against each other. A manager who pits employees against each other to achieve goals creates a toxic environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research, such as ”Felt or Thought: Distinct Mechanisms Underlying Exploitative Leadership and Abusive Supervision”  published in 2023 by Armin Pircher Verdorfer, Frank Belschak, and Andrea Bobbio, explores how exploitative leadership, a form of manipulative management, negatively affects employee satisfaction and social exchange relationships. Promoting transparency reduces gossip and improves trust within the team.
                </p>
                <h2>16. Tunnel Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    Tunnel vision is a narrow focus on one aspect of a project or goal, ignoring a broader context. It stifles creativity and collaboration. Tunnel vision, in a team setting, leads to neglected responsibilities and missed opportunities for innovation. A manager who fixates solely on meeting sales targets overlooks team morale and customer satisfaction, resulting in reduced team performance and low morale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scientific evidence by Riggio (2021) in “Leadership: Research Findings, Practice, and Skills” confirms that balanced attention is critical for effective management. Challenges arise in breaking tunnel vision. Holistic Perspective, which considers the whole picture fosters a well-rounded approach and enhances team dynamics. Addressing tunnel vision helps mitigate other ineffective management practices like poor listening habits
                </p>
                <h2>17. Gossip</h2>
                <p>
                    Gossip is the spread of unverified or private information within the workplace. Gossip creates distrust and division among team members, which undermines team cohesion and morale. A manager who participates in or condones gossip creates an environment of suspicion, leading to distrust and reduced productivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research by Kurland & Pelled (2000) in “Journal of Business Ethics” highlights the negative effects of gossip on organizational culture. Gossip makes building trust challenging. However, confidentiality promotes trust and integrity. Addressing gossip helps mitigate other issues like over-reliance on employee self-management.

                <h2>18. Over-Reliance on Employee Self-Management</h2>
                <p>
                    Over-reliance on employee self-management is expecting employees to manage tasks without sufficient guidance. Over-reliance on employee self-management leads to confusion and inconsistency. Over-reliance on employee self-management places undue stress on employees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A manager who seldom checks in with their team misses critical issues, leading to lowered team cohesion and effectiveness. Studies by Pearsall et al. (2010) in “Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes” show the importance of balanced supervision. Over-reliance on employee self-management challenges include finding the right level of oversight. Providing balanced guidance supports team success. Addressing over-reliance on employee self-management helps address other issues like insults.
                </p>
                <h2>19. Insults</h2>
                <p>
                    Insults are using demeaning language or behavior towards employees. Insults damage self-esteem and erode trust, creating a hostile work environment. A manager who publicly criticizes team members undermines their confidence, resulting in high turnover and low morale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Evidence from Tepper (2000) in “The Journal of Applied Psychology” links abusive supervision to negative outcomes. Insults make promoting respect challenging. Positive Reinforcement, which is offering constructive feedback fosters a supportive environment. Addressing insults helps reduce excessive anger.
                </p>
                <h2>20. Excessive Anger</h2>
                <p>
                    Excessive anger is frequent outbursts or aggressive behavior in the workplace. Excessive anger creates fear and reduces open communication. A manager who reacts angrily to mistakes fosters a culture of fear, leading to increased stress and reduced innovation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research by Spector & Fox (2005) in “Human Resource Management Review” shows the detrimental effects of workplace aggression. Challenges of excessive anger include managing emotions. Emotional Regulation, which is controlling emotions promotes a healthier work environment. Addressing anger helps improve other issues like appearance-obsessed.
                </p>
                <h2>21. Appearance-Obsessed</h2>
                <p>
                    Appearance-obsessed is focusing excessively on the physical appearance of oneself or others. Being appearance-obsessed diverts attention from meaningful contributions and skills, undermining professional credibility. A manager who prioritizes dress code over performance evaluations sends the wrong message, demotivating employees and creating a shallow work culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research by Rhode (2010) in “The Beauty Bias” confirms the negative impacts of appearance-based biases. Appearance-obsessed challenges include fostering an inclusive culture. Performance-oriented—focusing on skills and contributions enhances team productivity. Addressing appearance obsession helps mitigate other practices like unquestionable authority .

                <h2>22. Unquestionable Authority</h2>
                <p>
                    Unquestionable authority is asserting dominance without accepting feedback or questions. Unquestionable authority stifles innovation and critical thinking, leading to a lack of engagement and growth. A manager who ignores team input creates a stagnant work environment, resulting in reduced team morale and innovation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Studies by Argyris (1990) in “Overcoming Organizational Defenses” highlight the need for open dialogue. Challenges of unquestionable authority include fostering an open culture. Collaborative Leadership, which encourages team input enhances innovation and engagement. Addressing unquestionable authority helps improve other practices like poor listening habits.
                </p>
                <h2>23. Poor Listening Habits</h2>
                <p>
                    Poor listening habits are failing to listen to team members’ concerns and feedback actively. Poor listening habits lead to miscommunication and frustration, impeding effective decision-making. A manager who interrupts or disregards input misses valuable insights, resulting in low team morale and frequent misunderstandings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research by Brownell (2012) in “Listening: Attitudes, Principles, and Skills” underscores the importance of active listening. Poor listening habits challenges include improving communication skills. Active Listening, which is engaging fully with team members builds trust and understanding. Addressing poor listening helps mitigate other ineffective practices like avoiding face time.
                </p>
                <h2>24. They avoid face time</h2>
                <p>
                    They avoid face time is not spending enough in-person time with the team. Avoiding FaceTime creates a disconnect and hampers relationship-building, preventing effective team cohesion. A remote manager who seldom visits the office misses critical team dynamics, leading to reduced trust and team spirit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research by Allen et al. (2015) in “Remote Work: A Research Overview” shows the importance of in-person interactions. Challenges of avoiding face time include balancing remote and in-person work. Engagement, which prioritizes face-to-face interactions strengthens relationships. Addressing avoidance of face time helps improve other issues like obsessing over appearances.

                <p>
                    They obsess over appearances is excessively focusing on physical looks rather than work quality. Obsessing over appearances undermines true merit and skills, creating a demotivated team. A manager who judges employees based on attire instead of performance sends the wrong message, resulting in lowered morale and reduced productivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Studies by Rhode (2010) in “The Beauty Bias” highlight the negative consequences of appearance-based biases. Obsessing over appearances challenges include shifting focus to merit. Substance-over-style—valuing skills overlooks enhances team performance. Addressing appearance obsession helps mitigate other ineffective practices like blocking goals.
                </p>
                <h2>26. They block you from meeting your goals</h2>
                <p>
                    They block you from meeting your goals is hindering employees from achieving objectives. Blocking goals leads to frustration and stagnation, preventing professional growth and team success. A manager who denies resources needed for projects impedes progress, resulting in low motivation and high turnover.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research by Amabile & Kramer (2011) in “The Progress Principle” emphasizes the importance of supporting employee goals. Challenges of blocking goals include aligning team and individual goals. Goal Facilitation, which provides resources and support enhances productivity. Addressing goal-blocking helps improve other practices like disrespect of boundaries.
                </p>
                <h2>27. They don’t respect boundaries</h2>
                <p>
                    They don’t respect boundaries is overstepping personal or professional limits. This creates discomfort and stress, eroding trust and respect. A manager who contacts employees outside of work hours without urgent need disrupts work-life balance, leading to increased stress and burnout.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Studies by Kossek & Lautsch (2012) in “Work–Life Boundary Management Styles” highlight the importance of respecting boundaries. Challenges include setting clear limits. Boundary Respect—honoring boundaries promotes a healthy work-life balance. Addressing boundary disrespect helps mitigate other ineffective management practices like excessive anger.

                <h2>How does bad management manifest in workplace behavior?</h2>
                <p>
                    Bad management manifest in workplace behavior by creating a toxic environment where employees feel undervalued and stressed, leading to decreased productivity and morale. Studies by Harvard Business Review show that bad management, such as micromanagement, increases turnover and reduces job satisfaction, as highlighted in <a href="https://madssingers.com/management/micromanagement"><u>“Signs of Micromanagement: Causes and Prevention”</u></a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A manager who constantly checks on an employee’s work, focuses on minor details instead of results, and requests frequent updates, as noted by Wright in 2000, demonstrates the key signs of micromanagement. Such behaviors lead employees to feel demoralized, disengaged, and undervalued, ultimately fostering burnout and high-stress levels.

                <h3>How can bad people management be corrected?</h3>
                <p>
                    Bad people management can be corrected through training programs like the Mads Singers Effect Management Mastery course, Coursera’s “Leading People and Teams” specialization, and Harvard University’s “Management Essentials” course, which provide valuable insights and strategies to improve management skills and create a more positive workplace environment. 
                </p>
                <h3>How does poor communication influence team performance?</h3>
                <p>
                    Poor communication influences team performance by creating misunderstandings, conflicts, and low morale, which ultimately lead to decreased productivity and project failures. Poor communication in teams causes confusion and inefficiency, hindering overall team success.
                </p>
                <h3>What are consequences of a manager’s lack of feedback for employee development?</h3>
                <p>
                    The consequences of a manager’s lack of feedback for employee development are decreased employee motivation and engagement, resulting in higher turnover rates and reduced productivity. According to a study published in the Journal of Applied Psychology (2019), employees who do not receive regular feedback are more likely to feel undervalued and disengaged, which negatively impacts performance and job satisfaction.
                </p>
                <h3>What are toxic manager traits?</h3>
                <p>
                    Toxic manager traits are:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Micromanagement:</b> Overly controlling and not trusting employees to complete tasks independently.</li>
                    <li><b>Arrogance:</b> Displaying an inflated sense of self-importance and disregarding others’ contributions.</li>
                    <li><b>Inconsistency:</b> Frequently changing expectations and being unpredictable in decision-making.</li>
                    <li><b>Lack of empathy:</b> Failing to understand or consider employees’ feelings and perspectives.</li>
                    <li><b>Dishonesty:</b> Being untruthful or misleading, which erodes trust within the team.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>What are the signs of unprofessional behavior in management?</h3>
                <p>
                    The signs of unprofessional behavior in management are:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Micromanagement:</b> Micromanagement is when managers excessively control or closely observe the work of employees, leading to a lack of trust and autonomy.</li>
                    <li><b>Failure to Give Feedback:</b> Managers who do not provide constructive feedback or only offer criticism without recognizing positive contributions hinder employee growth and morale.</li>
                    <li><b>Showing Favoritism:</b> A manager who consistently gives preferred projects or special treatment to certain employees, creates a toxic work environment and demotivates other team members.</li>
                    <li><b>Verbal Abuse:</b> Verbal Abuse is being overly critical, making inappropriate comments, or publicly criticizing staff, which severely impacts employee well-being and productivity.</li>
                    <li><b>Not Accepting Responsibility:</b> Managers who refuse to take responsibility for actions or decisions and instead blame staff damage trust and respect within the team</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>How can unprofessional behavior in management harm workplace culture?</h3>
                <p>
                    Unprofessional behavior in management can harm workplace culture by decreasing morale, reducing productivity, and increasing turnover. Toxic behaviors undermine employee motivation, creating a sense of undervalue and disengagement. Workflow disruptions and poor collaboration caused by unprofessional conduct lead to inefficiencies and declining productivity. A hostile environment drives higher turnover as employees leave for healthier workplaces, which collectively damages <a href="https://madssingers.com/management/organizational-culture"><u>organizational culture</u></a>, success and cohesion.
                </p>
                <h4>Does a manager’s use of manipulation or blame-shifting erode employee trust?</h4>
                <p>
                    Yes, a manager’s use of manipulation or blame-shifting erodes employee trust. Such behaviors create a toxic culture, diminishing accountability and discouraging open communication. Research, including <i>“Blame Shifting in Leadership”</i> (2023), highlights that leaders who deflect responsibility foster fear and mistrust, undermining team morale and collaboration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The article <i>“Blame Shifting: A Critical Leadership Flaw That Undermines Team Trust”</i> (2024) explains how manipulation or blame-shifting breeds resentment, obstructs transparency, and damages team cohesion. Rooted in insecurity or narcissism, manipulation, and blame-shifting harm both relationships and organizational performance, making trust and accountability key to effective leadership.
                </p>
                <h4>Can a manager’s excessive focus on one aspect of work be detrimental to team success?</h4>
                <p>
                    Yes, a manager’s excessive focus on one aspect of work can be detrimental to team success. A manager who concentrates too heavily on a single aspect of work negatively impacts the overall performance and morale of the team. Research indicates that an overemphasis on tasks at the expense of people leads to significant drawbacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The article “Why Highly Efficient Leaders Fail” (2019) by Rebecca Zucker explains that focusing solely on tasks undermines relationship-building, team inspiration, and employee development. Similarly, “Micromanaging Examples: Top 20 Signs to Watch Out for in 2024” (2024) highlights that micromanagement, a form of excessive focus, stifles creativity and decreases team productivity.
                </p>
                <h4>Can a manager be mean without being bad?</h4>
                <p>
                    Yes, a manager can be mean without being bad. Managers who are tough or stern sometimes exhibit mean behavior, yet still achieve positive outcomes when managers’ actions are well-intentioned and goal-oriented, though the difference lies in motive and impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research like Dr. Emily Johnson’s “Tough Love in Leadership” (2022) suggests that a firm approach, when paired with support and fairness, inspires high performance. Similarly, Dr. Paul Losoff’s “The Fine Line Between Tough and Toxic Leadership” (2023) emphasizes that tough leadership is effective when maintaining team morale and avoids crossing into toxicity. Balancing accountability with empathy ensures that managers drive results without damaging relationships.

                <h3>What are signs of good people management?</h3>
                <p>
                    The signs of good people management are clear communication, timely feedback, and the ability to inspire and motivate teams, as highlighted in <a href="https://madssingers.com/management/signs-good"><u>“People Manager: 15 Signs of a Good People Management”</u></a>. Effective managers are visible, approachable, and treat employees fairly, fostering trust, transparency, and a positive work environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Effective managers actively invest in career growth, provide constructive feedback, and delegate tasks effectively, as noted in Denise Rousseau’s 2018 study, which links timely feedback to employee satisfaction, which reduces stress, and boosts productivity. Managers with strong communication skills, empathy, and emotional intelligence improve team cohesion and long-term performance, fostering innovation and employee retention.
